# Weather App üå§Ô∏è

Hey there!  
This is a simple yet handy real-time Weather App built using Python and Flask. It fetches live weather data for any city using the OpenWeatherMap API and shows you the temperature, humidity, wind speed, and even supports a dark mode for those late-night checks.

## What it does

- Shows you the current temperature, humidity, and wind speed of any city you search for.
- Lets you switch between light and dark themes ‚Äî because who doesn‚Äôt like a little night mode? üåô
- Updates data in real-time using the OpenWeatherMap API.
